# How to play
Forage potato and daikon seeds in the wilds down to the right. Return to your camp, visit your crops in the top left of your camp, plant your seeds. After some time, they'll have grown, and can be harvested. Go to sleep before it becomes dark and the storm gets you. You can then sell them to the trader who will give you money or rare blueberry seeds in return.
